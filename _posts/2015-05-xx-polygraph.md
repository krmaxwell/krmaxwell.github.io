# TL;DR
People selling training on how to beat a polygraph exam are probably guilty of
fraud but the penalty should reflect that they didn't defraud their customers.
The real victims of their fraud are the organizations which are also defrauding
themselves by relying on this horribly inaccurate measurement. The penalty should
also reflect that with a little care in how the training providers market their
material their product could be 100% legal.

# The folly of the poly
[Today I read an article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/polygraph-com-owner-pleads-guilty-to-training-customers-to-beat-polygraph/) about Douglas Williams, the man behind polygraph.com,
who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and mail fraud charges for teaching
people how to beat the lie detector tests used by three-letter agencies as part
of their employment process. I was intrigued because I wondered how, in the
United States with our strong first amendment protections, could someone be
guilty of a crime for sharing knowledge. This strikes a chord with me in part
because I'm also an educator and I have a deep loathing of the concept of
forbidden knowledge. Finally, of course, I'm interested because there are very
real problems with the polygraph and in a way this is very similar to the
punishing of security researchers that find flaws in software.

I'm going to make a bold claim here, *"I can beat a polygraph."* I'll go even
further and say that *"I can give completely false answers and pass a polygraph
exam."* However, I feel like that statement has to be tempered with *"I can also
give completely truthful answers and fail a polygraph exam."*

This claim is not even in dispute. [The Global Polygraph network claims](http://www.polytest.org/lie-detector-polygraph-information.asp) that a
properly done polygraph is 90-95% accurate. There are several other sources that
repeat the 90% claim but I haven't been able to figure out if that claim means that
90% of liars will be detected or if that means that 90% of individual lies will
be caught. Still, that 90% rate is for a single-issue test, meaning that they're
only going to ask about a single topic. By their own numbers, a multiple issue
test will have about 80% accuracy. Also, the number of relevant questions matters.
To quote from the above link:

> In general, the more relevant questions asked the less accurate the results
will be. ... Adding even one question to a specific issue test double the error
rate.

So if I were taking a polygraph intended to simulate the test that DHS would give
me as part of their employment screening the best case scenario is that one out
of five times I would fail even if I gave truthful answers. However, if they ask
multiple questions about the issues of concern (drug use, criminal associates, etc) then
we might be looking at failing 2 out of 5 times in the best case scenario. If
there are any problems around question design or techniques used this can easily
get to be a 50/50 crap shoot.

And in fact other scientific sources seem to indicate that it is exactly that.
I am blatantly stealing sources from Wikipedia here, but the National Academy of
Sciences has thoroughly ripped the poly to shreds. I appreciate, in particular,
their point that even if the test was as accurate as claimed, it would still be
terrible for detecting spies because of the [Base rate fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). You would reject thousands
of qualified truthful candidates to weed out some of the spies.

## The immeasurable value of the poly
All that having been said, the poly is an amazing tool and there is probably a
good reason that the government continues to use it. When used as part of a complete
theater production it can create a very convincing [appeal to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) that most
candidates will accept.

A candidate is brought in and told about the infallibility of the machine. The
person is told stories of all the liars that were caught by the machine, and most
importantly they're told about the stakes if the machine says that they lied. They
are connected to a very scientific looking machine the output of which they can't
interpret and then they're asked uncomfortable questions.

When it's over the investigator appeals to the authority of the machine saying
that the machine things they're lying about some part of the questioning. And if
they've put on a good show the candidate might believe that this infallible machine
has detected their lie. It's really no different than a police interrogator telling
a suspect that the suspect's partner just confessed in the other room and implicated
him as well. If you believe the investigator ([or even if you don't](http://www.innocenceproject.org/news-events-exonerations/polygraph-tests-contribute-to-false-confessions-in-chicago)) you migth
confess in exchange for a more lenient sentence. Or you might confess if the
investigator tells you that this is a minor admission that wont affect your
employment and if you don't admit to it then it will delay your employment and
possibly result in a different candidate being hired.

# Is this forbidden knowledge?
Since the US government uses the polygraph in employment screening for sensitive
positions there is an obvious incentive to keep it under wraps that this serious
weakness exists in their screening. When governments try to censor these facts it
becomes [Forbidden Knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_knowledge).
The first amendment to the US Constitution makes it difficult to censor information
about the polygraph. However the US government has been able to use fraud laws to
go after people selling training on how to beat the polygraph. Essentially the
reason I'm able to tell you everthing I did above is because I'm not selling it for
the express purpose of beating a real polygraph.

# The specific fraud
[The indictment against Douglas Williams](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/williamsindictment.pdf) accused him of defrauding the federal government by obtaining money and property by means of the materially
false statements of his clients. He enriched himself by helping his customers lie to the government.
For example, the indictment claims that he instructed people on specific lies to tell, and
specific facts to omit. We can only speculate, but the lies probably consist of
not telling the government that they know the polygraph is bullshit because they
will reject a candidate that doesn't appear to be taken in by the security theater.
Most importantly, an undercover investigator told Williams that he had made false
statements to DHS and Williams agreed to help with the deception by treaching the
undercover agent how to lie on the test.

It's a fine line, but once he should have known that he was helping someone defraud
the government then the act of taking money to assist with that fraud is itself an
act of fraud. So the government has a case and Williams was probably wise to eventually
enter a guilty plea.

# Could it have been legal?
I believe it is possible to legally offer information about how to beat the polygraph
as I've done above. I also think it's possible to legally sell training on how to
beat a hypothetical polygraph test, as long as you don't claim that you're selling
this training so that they can beat the specific polygraph test given to people
that are seeking employment with the government. It's kind of like how stores are
able to sell crack pipes and marijuana pipes as long as you don't say anything to
suggest that you're going to use these things for smoking illegal drugs.

In the case of Williams, the undercover investigator told him several times that he
intended to lie to the government about his involvement in illegal smuggling. By
continuing to cooperate Williams became party to that smuggling. If Williams had
told the undercover that they couldn't do business the first time the undercover
said that then he probably wouldn't be looking at 20 years.

# The sentence should fit the crime
Although Williams did knowingly engage in a schema to make money by encouraging
people to lie to the government, the government going after people like Williams
seems like an effort to censor the knowledge that the polygraph can't actually
do anything except persuade you to make an admission. If the government were
screening people based on their height to weight ratio and I sold training on
how to dehydrate yourself to pass the test would it really be worth 20 years?
What Williams did might technically be fraud but the government is relying
on a modern day fortune tellers to decide who can work for them. What should the
penalty be for pointing out that a fortune teller is full of shit?

It also seems oddly similar
to efforts to go after security researchers that publish vulnerabilities in
software. In this case the government has a serious vulnerability in their
applicant screening process and instead of fixing the vuln by investing in different
controls, they prosecute people that point out the problems with their process.

So when we try to decide how to penalize Mr. Williams we shouldn't ask ourselves
what the penalty should be for defauding the government. We should ask what the
penalty should be for revealing that professional wrestling is [kayfabe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe).
