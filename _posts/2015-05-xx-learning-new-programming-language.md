Instruction for people who already understand code is good (think http://learncodethehardway.org/ not http://www.codecademy.com/learn).

I'm liking [A re-introduction to Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) for this reason.

Also, learn through projects and drills, not just reading.
