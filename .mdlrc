rules "~MD013,~MD023,~MD026,~MD029,~MD033,~MD036"

# MD013 Line length
# MD023 Headers must start at the beginning of the line (doesn't work for code comments)
# MD026 Trailing punctuation in header (I almost like this rule but need to allow ?s)
# MD029 Ordered list item prefix
# MD033 Inline HTML (sometimes you just gotta)
# MD036 Emphasis used instead of a header
